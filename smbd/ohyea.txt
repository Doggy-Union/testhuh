What is love at all? I guess most of us prefer to think it's honorable and beaty feeling. But now look at this from another point of view: most of relationships between people are become to reality due to random meeting. Absolutely random. There's no any magic connection between man and woman.
...In fact, i think also it is nice as well. Because you can just know new people in your life: there will be no one the same.
